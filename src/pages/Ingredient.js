          for a quick scan or by manual entry for a hands-on approach. Our system adapts to your 
          preferred method, ensuring convenience at every step.
        </li>
        </ul>
          2. User Skin Profile Integration:

               seamlessly with your skin profile, ensuring that ingredient recommendations are finely
                tuned to your skin's unique characteristics.
